legend=_("Anhalt was a German state. Initially a county, it was split\
 from Saxony in 1212. For most of its history, it was partitioned into\
 several territories that were ruled by the same family. The counts of\
 Anhalt were raised to dukes upon the dissolution of the Holy Roman\
 Empire by Napoleon in 1806. Anhalt was reunited into a single duchy in\
 1863. Upon the downfall of the German monarchies in 1918, it became a\
 free state. After World War II, Anhalt finally ceased to exist when the\
 allies decided to merge it with the former Prussian Province of Saxony\
 to form the state of Saxony-Anhalt.")
